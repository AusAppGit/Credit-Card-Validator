# Credit Card Validator
A code response to Sololearn's Code Coach Challenge titled, "Credit Card Validator".
The code should take a string as input to evaluate. Output is a string "valid" or "not valid" depending on if the characters within the string meet the requirements
of the Luhn Test.  The Luhn Formula goes like this: 1. Reverse the number 2. Multiply every second digit by 2 3. Subtract 9 from all numbers higher than 9 4. Add all the digits together 5. Modulo 10 of that sum should be equal to 0.
